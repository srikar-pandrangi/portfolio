            <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering Graduate from NIT Warangal, India. My passion for design awoke in 2022 during my final year of undergrad. Since then, I have been learning multiple types of designs (UI/UX, Logos, Brand Identities, Packaging, Posters, etc.).</p>
            <p>In Nov 2023, I quit my job as a consultant and started to learn and practice design as my full-time gig. From May 2024, I have been freelancing and have successfully delivered designs for multiple clients and have done a few passion projects, which you can check out in my work.</p>
            <p>If you are reading this and are interested to work with me, hit me up on any of the given platforms, and we can take the discussion forward.</p>
